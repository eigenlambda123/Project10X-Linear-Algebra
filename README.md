# Linear Algebra 10X Builder Series

> Learn Linear Algebra by building 10 practical projects inspired by Gilbert Strang’s *Introduction to Linear Algebra*.

---

## About

This repository is designed to help you **learn Linear Algebra deeply and effectively** by building real, hands-on projects covering key concepts from Strang’s book. Instead of passively reading or memorizing, you’ll implement, visualize, and experiment with vectors, matrices, linear transformations, and more.

This is the Linear Algebra counterpart to my [Project10X-The-Backend-Builder-Series](https://github.com/yourusername/backend10x), using a project-based learning approach tailored for math.

---

## Goals

- Cover core Linear Algebra topics from Strang’s first few chapters through practical coding projects
- Build intuition with visualizations and interactive tools
- Develop a solid foundation useful for machine learning, computer graphics, and applied mathematics
- Encourage incremental learning: complete projects step-by-step while mastering theory simultaneously

## How to Use

1. **Pick a project** from the list above based on your current topic of study in Strang’s book.  
2. **Read the relevant chapter/section** in the book to understand the theory.  
3. **Follow the project’s README and implementation files** to build and experiment with the concepts.  
4. **Try the stretch goals** to deepen understanding and add extra features.  
5. **Commit your progress and notes** regularly to track your learning journey.
